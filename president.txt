Let there be a graph which represents a city, with N edges and M nodes with weights w(i), 
which represent the time needed to cross adjacent nodes (city points). 
We want to know the minimum Sw(i), given a starting point A and an ending point B, 
which refers to minimum time to go from point A to point B.
There is a list c(1),c(2),...,c(K) of the city's points. At the moment t=0, w(c(1),c(2)) is 
unavailable for our path. At t=w(c(1),c(2))+w(c(2),c(3)), w(c(2),c(3)) is 
unavailable for our path. We start from point A at t=T, and want to know the minimum duration of the trip.
Input : N<=60000 Nodes
	N-1<=M<=300000 edges
	A starting point
	B ending point
      0<=T<=10000 starting minute
	3<=K<=N size of c-array 
	c[1]...c[K] node-restriction list
      0<=u,v,d(u,v)<=10000 edge between u-v nodes
Output : Minimum trip duration
