In a Galaxy far far away, the Empire decides to build a new space station, for commerce business. 
For this reason, she creates transport channels between planets. 
The creation cost, between planets i and j costs A[i,j]. 
There are also K-planets capable of hosting teleporters! 
The cost of a teleporter at the i-planet is B[i]. 
The only way to transfer the essentials between two planets, is for them to be 
connected through a combination of transport channels and/or teleporters. 
Input  : N number of planets
	       K number of planets capable of building a teleporter
	       M number of possible transport channels
	       B[i] cost of building a teleporter in i-planet
	       i,j,A[i,j] cost of building a transport channel between planets i and j
Output : Minimum cost (if there is one), to make possible the transfer between any two planets
